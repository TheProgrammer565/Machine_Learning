												Machine Learning

Introduction:

-> Machines are getting sharper and smarter than humans.
-> A chess playing computer called DEEP BLUE was designed by IBM to interact with real time chess champions.
-> It also defeated world champion Garry Kasparov.
-> Inputs taken while playing formulates into an algorithm.
-> Machines tend to be over smart than humans and are capable of making bold decisions.
-> Machine Learning  has been practiced since 1970's and the term was coined in 1959.
-> "A computer program is said to learn from experience with respect to some class of tasks and performance 
measures.Its performance improves with more exposure to tasks".
-> Alan Turing published a paper named "Computer Machinery and Intelligence" which discussed the growing
inclination towards the machine learning and also where the machine can think like humans or not.

Getting Started:

-> ML has taken the market by storm.
-> Individuals from different backgrounds want to get into this field.
-> Nowadays IOT devices,sensors and CCTV cameras are used to collect data that provide useful insights to 
learn and explore new areas of improvement for the company.

Basic Fundamental Steps:
	Supervised ML:
		-> This learning includes algorithm that are designed based on the target variable, which is to be
		predicted or calculated with a given set of  independent values known as predictors.
		-> Starts with the analysis of the known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred
		function that makes prediction about the output values.
	
	Unsupervised ML:
		-> This learning includes algorithm that are used for clustering and has no target variable of the 
		coefficient to predict in the picture.
		-> K-Means and Apriori are prime examples of this kind of learning.
		-> Unsupervised ML studies shows how the systems can infer a function and describe the hidden structure
		from the unlabelled data.
		
	Reinforcement ML:
		-> It is a learning techniques that interacts with its environment and produces actions and then 
		discovers errors or rewards.
		-> Trial and Error Search and delayed rewards are the most relevant characteristics of the reinforcement
		Machine learning.
		-> This enables machines to automatically determine the ideal behaviour with the specific context in order
		to maximize its performance.
		
Groundwork:
	-> Machine Learning is derived from statistics as its base.
	-> Statistics is the subdivision of mathematics that deals with the data collection, categorization, 
	interpretation and presentation.
	-> It can handle all phases of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the designs of 
	surveys and experiments.
	-> At times when companies need a profitable business model which can deliver interms of flexibility and 
	reliability, they are bound to apply machine learning techniques to deliver immense value to the business.
	-> The company has to look into some glaring factors which could shape the foundation for these technologies.
	
Reinforcement Learning in Machine Learning:
	-> It is an important foundation for artificial intelligence.
	-> It has a dynamic programming mechanism that trains the agent using constants of success and failure.
	-> It needs to have an uninterrupted interaction with its current surroundings by absorbing and gaining from it.
	This process is carried out for quite some time until the host understands the difference between right and wrong.
	-> Considering that external human intervention is minimal, the agents can learn and interpret the current scenario
	on their own.
	
	-> ML has an integral part to play in reinforcement learning as the agents learn from their mistakes and ensure
	that it won't repeat again.
	-> But unlike ML, where the machines are expected to produce a certain output, this training agents come up with
	their own observations and inferences.
	-> There are certain algorithms of control learning that are used to execute this process like a criterion for 
	optimality, brute force and direct policy search.
	-> Example of reinforcement learning includes Boston Dynamics, a newly invented agent Spotmini.It was designed
	and manufactured on the principles of self-learning and self-evaluation, which made it easy to overcome external 
	circumstances while closing a door.
	
Statistics as the BASE in ML:
	-> Statistics deals with the data collection, preparation, examination and presentation.Statistical population
	or statistical model analysis are taken care of with the help of stats.
	-> Statisticians came up with interesting insights and findings that are used for different statistical techniques
	in data before machine learning became mainstream.
	-> They used to undergo the task of :
			-> Assembling the measurements of the system under the radar.
			-> Manipulating
			-> Capturing additional measurements.
			-> Determine if the manipulation has changed the values of the readings or not.
	
	Fundamentals in Statistics:
		-> Mean and Median:
				-> Mean is the arithmetic average of the data values.It comes under the central tendency of stats.Mean 
				takes into consideration all the values for computation.
				-> Median is the central observation when all observations are arranged in order of magnitude. It is a 
				important measure of central tendency.Median is the observation that divides the series into two equal 
				halves.
		
		-> Skewness, Kurtosis and Variance:
				-> Skewness illustrates the level of degree a set of data varies when compared to standard distribution
				in a set of statistical data.
				-> Its resultant curve depends on the data, whether the data is having positive or negative skew towards
				the data average.
				
				-> Kurtosis measures the data for light-tailed which means less outlier prone or heavy-tailed when compared
				to the normal distribution.
				
				-> Variance is the measurement of the span of numbers in a dataset.It is also the square of standard deviation.
	
ML MODELS:
	
	-> Linear Regression:
			-> Part of predictive analysis.
			-> Common algorithm used for prediction of data values in numeric form.
			-> Numeric input and output values.
			-> Coefficient represented by beta in a linear equation.
			-> Another coefficient is added, providing the line and additional degree of freedom, which is known as intercept.
			-> A simple linear regression equation represented as: Y = β0 + β1 x
		-> The overall notion of regression is to examine two important criteria:
			-> Given a group of input variables predict the dependent variable.
			-> Which variables are real predictors of the dependent variable and what is their impact on the outcome variable?
		-> Reliability of linear regression model can be tested with the help of the following functions:
			
			-> Line of Best Fit:
					-> Validation line which explains the direct correlation between the observed values and the calculated ones.
					-> Helps to understand the difference in distance of the predicted values to the real ones.
					-> Residuals are symbolized by the vertical lines showing the comparison between the predicted values and 
					the actual values.

		-> Gradient Descent:
			-> Introduced in linear regression in order to find the minimalistic cost of a function in the equation.
			-> Depending on the convex function, gradient descent function makes a small changes to minimize function to a 
			possible local minimum.
			-> Two important terms:
				-> Learning rate and Cost function.
				-> Size of each step measured by the learning rate.
				-> The curve plotted has its own slope which updates the parameters and how to make the model more accurate.
				It is known as cost function.
	
	-> Polynomial Regression:
			-> Used to find the relation between the dependent and the independent variable.
			-> In linear regression, the line of best fit my end up under-fitting the data points.
			-> Polynomial regression improves the model and finds a more subtle relationship between the variables.
			-> Focus on the curve at the ends and check whether those trends make any sense.Sometimes, higher polynomials 
			may end up producing mysterious results on extrapolation.

	-> Lasso Regression:
			-> Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator is similar to ridge regression in terms of working which
			changes the size of regression coefficients.
			-> Can reduce variablility.
			-> Advances the accuracy of linear regression models.
			-> Lasso regression handles real absolute values in the penalty functions rather than in squares like in Rich.
			This enables it to penalize values which caused some of the paramater estimates to be exactly zero.
			-> If the penalty is high, then the estimates get shrunk to zero.This results in variable selection out of
			the given n variables.
			-> Assumptions made in the algorithm are:
					-> Same as the least square regression except that normality is not to be assumed here.
					-> Shrinks the coefficients to zero.
					-> Uses Regularisation technique and adopts L1 regularisation.
					-> If a group of predictors is highly correlated, then it picks one of them and shrinks the others to zero.
					
Clustering Models of ML:
	-> K-Means Clustering:
			-> Unsupervised learning algorithm
			-> Utilized for unlabelled data.
			-> Modus operandi of k-means is to determine the number of groups present in the data.These groups are 
			represented as "k".
			-> The algorithm assigns each data point to one of the "k" groups iteratively.These data points are clustered
			together based on similarity.
			-> Clustering can be :
				-> Used for exploratory data analysis to get a rough estimation of the structure of data.
				-> Used to find the subgroups in the data where the data points in the subgroup are similar to each other
				in characteristics while points in other groups are different.
			-> k-means has the job of polarizing homogeneous subgroups within the data, wherein all the data points in all
			the groups exist within the data are similar.

			-> Basic steps used to cluster any data point are:
					-> Define the number of "k" clusters.
					-> Intialize the centroids.
					-> Perform this iteration until there is no change to the centroids.
					-> Sum of the squared distance between the dtaa points and all centroids.
					-> Assign each data point to the closest centroid.
					-> Estimate the centroid for the clusters by taking the average of all the data points that are
					assigned to each cluster.
			
			-> Usecases:
					-> Managing Sensors: Sensors collect different types like audios, images etc... in its database.
					K-Means is used to separate that data and create different categories.
					-> Managing Inventory: An inventory consists of diverse data like sales activity, manufacturing data,
					import-export data etc... which is grouped into categories by k-means.
	
	-> Hierarchical Clustering:
			-> Hierarchy is level of clusters that are involved in the dataset.
			-> Hierarchical Clustering involves groups of clusters which are merged and its working can be shown in the
			form of dendrogram.
			
			-> Types:
					-> Divisive:
						-> Also known as top-down clustering.
						-> Includes data points assigned to single cluster which can be segregated into two or more 
						similar looking clusters.
						-> Each cluster is examined recursively until the algorithm settles for one data point.
						-> Has more rewards when compared to the agglomerative approach due to its capability of 
						producing more accurate hierarchies for diverse datasets.
					
					-> Agglomerative:
						-> Defines a bottom-up approach.
						-> Assigns the clusters to the data points and merges them with each other just like divisive.
						-> Mandatory to introduce a proximity matrix which contains the distance between each point with
						the help of distance function.
						-> This matrix needs to be updated for it to display the distance between each cluster.
						
						-> Three methods used to check the distance between each cluster:
							-> Single  Linkage: Includes the concept of defining the distance between two clusters as 
							the shortest distance between two points in each cluster.
							
											Figure for Single Linkage => Refer 1(C)
										
							-> Complete Linkage: The longest distance between points of two nearby clusters which can 
							also be termed as the longest distance for each cluster is defined in the complete linkage.
							
											Figure for Complete Linkage => Refer 1(D)
							
							-> Average Linkage: This defines the average distance between data points of two nearest
							clusters.
